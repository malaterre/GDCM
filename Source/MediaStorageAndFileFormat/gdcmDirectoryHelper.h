/**
 * \brief DirectoryHelper
 * this class is designed to help mitigate some of the commonly performed
 * operations on directories.  namely:
 * 1) the ability to determine the number of series in a directory by what type
 * of series is present
 * 2) the ability to find all ct series in a directory
 * 3) the ability to find all mr series in a directory
 * 4) to load a set of DataSets from a series that's already been sorted by the
 * IPP sorter
 * 5) For rtstruct stuff, you need to know the sopinstanceuid of each z plane,
 * so there's a retrieval function for that
 * 6) then a few other functions for rtstruct writeouts
