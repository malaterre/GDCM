# - Find PHP5
# This module finds if PHP5 is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
#  PHP5_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where php.h can be found
#  PHP5_EXECUTABLE         = full path to the php5 binary
