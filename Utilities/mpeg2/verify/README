The file 'verify' is a simple Unix shell script.  When run, (e.g. "csh
verify" or "verify" at the command line) it will compare output between
the encoder's picture sequence reconstruction and the decoder's picture
sequence reconstruction.

A second test compares the output of the decoder.

The unix tool "cmp" is used to compare two files.
