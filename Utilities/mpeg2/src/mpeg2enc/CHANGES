CHANGES
=======

Since July 4, 1994 edition:

  Summary:
   only very minor changes since version 1.1a, distributed two years 
   ago.  A beta version of this program has significantly greater
   number of changes (.par file syntax, restructured motion.c ,
   zero-block test of Note 4.1.1, etc.)

  1. as per suggestion of Peter Loje Hansen <plh@tdr.dk>:

  -  corrected line 631 of motion.c so field_estimate uses 
     backward search range variables (sxb, syb) instead of 
     forward search range variables (sxf, syf).

  -  corrected line 250 in putseq.c, replacing .sxf with .syf


  2. many user suggestions:
  -  prevent divide by zero in SNR calculation in stat.c.

  3. general:
  - eliminated support for non ANSI C compilers  in makefile.
